        "dc_description_s": "This dataset represents the dam break inundation zones that are affiliated with the dams that are regulated by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) at the state level. It also includes dam inundation zones for federally regulated dams (e.g. South Fork Rivanna Reservoir dam). They include private and public dams. This dataset was created in 2013 and may get updates from time to time.State code requires dam owners to submit inundation zone mapping to their locality (no deadline). The code also requires localities to submit development applications occurring within a mapped dam inundation zone to DCR for review within 10 days. DCR has 45 days to respond. Applicability: For the purpose of this regulation, development is defined to include land to be used for a) any business or industrial purpose; b) is to contain three or more residential dwelling units and does not include agricultural production; and c) subdivision. The development review process is triggered once DCR has approved the mapping. Typically a dam owner would not submit a map to the County until it has been reviewed &amp; approved by DCR, but if they did submit an unapproved map, we would not be responsible for reviewing development against a draft version. Once the County gets an official dam inundation map, GIS staff at the County must incorporate that mapping* into this dataset which will then later update our permit tracking system and online GIS resources. Should DCR find that a proposed development would affect spillway standards, the County may not approve development unless developer amends the plan or contributes 50% of the cost of dam upgrades. Local governments are responsible for holding these funds in escrow until the dam upgrades are completed.*Typically, dam inundation mapping that is supplied to the County includes a few different layers, e.g. Sunny Day Breach, Spillway Design Flood (SDF) w/ or w/o breach, Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) w/ or without Breach. The County review process is only concerned with the layer that depicts the largest area (geographically speaking) that would be affected by a dam breach. Therefore, whatever layer encompasses the largest area for a given dam will be the area that gets put into this layer.Note: Federally regulated dams are exempt from the aboe mentioned state code requirements which only affect state regulated dams.",

Housing may be a combination of these unit types and commercial development is to be provided at a floor area ratio of 0.4 per acre or higher.  Developments may have a combination of residential and commercial use.  UDAs can accommodate 10 – 20 years of projected growth.  They are established to improve coordination between transportation and land use.  More detailed density and intensity recommendations for Albemarle County’s UDA areas are shown in the Places 29 and Pantops Master Plans.  It is expected that state and local funding for transportation and other improvements will be directed to UDAs where feasible.The UDA boundaries were put in place for Albemarle County in 2011.",

Otherwise, a Historic Conservation District does not impose requirements on the current residents who may want to rehabilitate their homes.A Historic Conservation District is different from an Architectural Design Control (ADC) District in three main respects: (1) Unlike in an ADC District, where review is required of all exterior changes to existing buildings, in a Historic Conservation District no BAR approval is required for rehabilitations of an existing building, or for smaller additions and demolitions; (2) The Historic Conservation District guidelines have been greatly condensed and simplified; and (3) The residents of a Historic Conservation District help identify neighborhood features to be preserved.",

This ensures a public notification and review process before changes can be made to a protected property.  ",
